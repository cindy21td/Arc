Carl rounds the corner to see...
ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed, her overalls are patched and dirty. The old house has been transformed into a make-believe dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty old bicycle.

Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape. Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks.
Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.   Each has a light. Hunters.

The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire.
The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end.

The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS.
They surround the prey.   Escape looks impossible. WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the three dogs and escaping in a flash.
The dogs head off in pursuit. A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears wincing in pain. They whimper and run off.

Sure enough.
The dog sits.

Russell falls to his knees, pleading.
Carl grabs Russell.   The bird follows, as does Dug.

A clap of thunder. Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring down on the house. Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire.
Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg.        He rolls his eyes and looks up at the house.
Russell struggles to set up the tent.       He reads his manual.

Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon.
Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls. Four more large dogs join the group.    Carl and Russell watch warily and continue their march.
They round a bend.     Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING.



1
The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group approaches the huge cave opening.
DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop. More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there are more dogs!
Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell. Closer... closer...
From the darkness a voice:
The dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness.      It examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house.

BIRD!

Dogs descend down the ramp behind them.
Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening. Dogs block the cave opening.        Carl stops short.
Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.     Carl and Russell run toward him.
The cave leads to a steep incline.      The dogs are getting closer. There's no choice but to JUMP.
The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts.
The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts Carl and Russell on her back. She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her. Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.

Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.
Quiet.
Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside. Carl surveys the room.
The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him.   He opens it and puts Ellie's drawing back. He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie. He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.
Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but Ellie never made it. He closes the book.   But as he does, Carl sees something he hadn't before.
The blank pages at the end are no longer blank. A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them. On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another... photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs. Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw adventure in everyday life.
A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written:
"THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE!

He crosses his heart.
